## Project Overview

This project implements a smart energy meter that measures voltage, current, power, and energy consumption, then transmits the data wirelessly using LoRa technology. The system consists of two main components:

1. **Sender Unit**: Measures electrical parameters using voltage and current sensors, displays readings on an LCD, and transmits data via LoRa.
2. **Receiver Unit**: Receives data from the sender unit and displays it on a serial monitor.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Measures voltage, current, power, and energy consumption
- **Wireless Communication**: Uses LoRa (RFM95W) for long-range, low-power data transmission
- **Visual Feedback**: LCD display on sender unit and LED indicators for transmission status
- **Energy Calculation**: Calculates and displays energy consumption in watt-hours
- **Complete Simulation**: Fully simulated in Proteus for testing before hardware implementation

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Libraries:
  - SPI
  - LoRa
  - Wire
  - LiquidCrystal_I2C
  - EmonLib
- Proteus Design Suite (for simulation)

## Simulation Setup

1. Open the Proteus project files:
   - `Smart_Meter_Arduino_Nano_Send.pdsprj` for the sender unit
   - `Smart_Meter_Arduino_Nano_Receive.pdsprj` for the receiver unit

2. Compile the Arduino sketches and generate HEX files:
   - `Smart_Energy_Meter_Arduino_nano_lora_sender.ino` for the sender unit
   - `Smart_Energy_Meter_Arduino_nano_lora_Receive.ino` for the receiver unit

3. Load the HEX files into the respective Arduino Nano components in Proteus

4. Run the simulation to observe the system in action

## How It Works

### Sender Unit
1. Reads voltage from the voltage sensor on pin A0
2. Reads current from the current sensor on pin A1
3. Calculates power (P = V Ã— I) and energy consumption
4. Displays all measurements on the LCD
5. Transmits data via LoRa every 2 seconds
6. Indicates transmission with LED indicators

### Receiver Unit
1. Continuously listens for incoming LoRa packets
2. Parses received data to extract voltage, current, power, and energy values
3. Displays received values on the serial monitor
4. Indicates reception with LED indicators

## Calibration

The system includes calibration constants that may need adjustment based on your specific sensors:

- Voltage sensor: Calibration value of 187.0 (may need adjustment)
- Current sensor: Sensitivity of 185 mV/A for a 5A module (adjust based on your sensor)
- Offset voltage: 2542 mV (adjust based on your sensor's zero-current output)
